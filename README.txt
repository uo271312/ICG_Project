To Do List
1. Instead of moles make a textured 3d object (i think this will be easier) ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpnd11doMgc 
2. Add a button to pause and restart the game (p->pause , r->restart)
3. Keep the track of player's score. When you click on an object score should increase
4. Game should last 20 seconds.
4. Add a bomb if you can, when you click on it the game is over.

Optional:
1. Add a sun
